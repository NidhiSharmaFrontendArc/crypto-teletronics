# Running it through Docker 

1. `docker build -t getting-started .` for me it's `docker build -t game-connect-dots . `

Start your container using the `docker run` command and specify the name of the image we just created:

2. `docker run -d -p 3000:3000 getting-started`

Remember the -d and -p flags? We're running the new container in "detached" mode (in the background) and creating a mapping between the host's port 3000 to the container's port 3000. Without the port mapping, we wouldn't be able to access the application.

After a few seconds, open your web browser to http://localhost:3000. You should see our app!


Go ahead and add an item or two and see that it works as you expect. You can mark items as complete and remove items. Your frontend is successfully storing items in the backend! Pretty quick and easy, huh?
